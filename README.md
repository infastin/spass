# Simple Pulse Audio Share Script
It is a script for streaming audio from PC to Android using Pulse Audio.
## Installation
```bash
git clone git@github.com:infastin/spass.git
cd spass
sudo ./install.sh
```
## Android apps
I couldn't find better app than **Simple Protocol Player**.  
It is available at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaytat.simpleprotocolplayer) and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.jakse.raphael.simpleprotocolplayer).  

But maybe there are better ones.
